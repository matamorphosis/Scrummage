## Reporting a Vulnerability

While many projects have a more formal procedure, please simply create an issue [here](https://github.com/matamorphosis/Scrummage/issues/new/choose) and explain the vulnerability.

## Rewards
As Scrummage currently generates no revenue, we cannot offer any monetary reward for vulnerabilities found by the community. However, we are happy to acknowledge you as the individual/entity who discovered the issue.
